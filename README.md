# MING-GPT

Minimal GPT written in Numpy.

## Usage

Before anything, generate a vocabulary with `Gen_Vocab.py`.
The main file `GPT.py` contains a pre-setup model and can be run immediately after generating vocabulary. Some configs are in the `__init__` block of GPT class.
All other configurations can be seen and changed in `config.py`.
